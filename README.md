# Design of experiments related text replacements for the Voice-In speech-to-text software

## Installation

- Download the `doe.csv` file.
- Copy the contents and paste them into the bulk add window of your Voice In Plus account.
- Click on the edit button at the bottom of the bulk ad window for the pasted text to be saved. Your existing commands will not be overwritten unless they have the same term in the left column.

## Usage

Say the term in the left column to insert the text in the right column.
The term in the left column can be thought of as a `voice trigger` and analogy to a `tab trigger` associated with snippet libraries in text editors.
Sorry, I have not yet figured out how to use one's voice to advance to what would be `tab stop`s or `voice stops` where parameter values need to be changed.
